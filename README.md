#~/.vim

This is my `~/.vim` folder. I'm using [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) to manage my plugins. If you want to download it feel free to do it.

To make have this configuration working make sure to have your `~/.vimrc` file just with 

```
source ~/.vim/.vimrc
```

Psst! If you don't have a `.vimrc` file the easiest way to do it is just run

```
$ echo "source ~/.vim/.vimrc" >> ~/.vimrc
```

And that's it! I will be updating this repo as I start using more plugins or changing my vim configuration. If you want to discuss your vim config or just talk about code shout me a tweet! [@soypatobeltran](https://twitter.com/soypatobeltran)
